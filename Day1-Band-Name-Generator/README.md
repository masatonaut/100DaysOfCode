### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Start with a greeting**:
   - Use `print()` to welcome users to your Band Name Generator. This sets a friendly tone for your program.
2. **Ask for the city**:

   - Use `input()` to ask the user for the city they grew up in. This piece of information will form the first part of the band name.

3. **Inquire about the pet**:

   - Next, ask for the user's pet's name with another `input()`. This will be used as the second part of the band name.

4. **Generate the band name**:
   - Combine the names of the city and the pet with a space in between to form the band name. Use `print()` to display the result to the user.

### Tips:

- Make sure to use clear and concise prompts to ensure that users know exactly what information to provide.
- Concatenate strings carefully to avoid formatting issues, ensuring that the band name looks professional and is easy to read.
