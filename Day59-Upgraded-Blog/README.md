# Clean Blog Navigation Enhancement

This project enhances the navigation bar of the "Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog" theme. The JavaScript code dynamically changes the navigation bar's visibility and fixed position based on the user's scroll direction.

## Features

- **Scroll-Up Detection**: When the user scrolls up, the navigation bar becomes visible.
- **Scroll-Down Detection**: When the user scrolls down, the navigation bar hides and becomes fixed when the scroll position exceeds the header height.
- **Smooth Animation**: The navigation bar smoothly transitions between visible and fixed states.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A web browser to test the functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have the "Clean Blog" theme files, including the HTML and CSS.

## Usage

1. Include the JavaScript code snippet in your HTML file within the `<head>` or `<body>` tags.
2. Ensure your HTML file contains an element with the `id` of `mainNav`, representing the navigation bar.
