## Caesar Cipher: A Python Encoding and Decoding Tool

This Python tool provides a straightforward method to encode and decode messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique. By shifting letters a certain number of positions in the alphabet, users can encrypt or decrypt messages. The program uses a single Python file, `caesar_cipher.py`, which contains the main logic for the cipher operations.

### How to Use

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to choose between encoding and decoding a message. You will then enter the text to be transformed and specify the number of positions to shift the letters.

### What You Need to Know

- **caesar_cipher.py**: Handles the encoding and decoding processes.

#### caesar_cipher.py

- Requests user input to determine the direction of ciphering (encoding or decoding).
- Prompts for the message to be ciphered and the shift amount.
- Adjusts the shift amount to ensure it remains within the bounds of the alphabet's length.
- Displays the result after encoding or decoding.

### Features

- **Dynamic Letter Shifting**: Allows any shift amount, automatically adjusted to fit within the 26-letter alphabet.
- **Continuous Operation**: Users can run multiple encoding or decoding operations back-to-back by choosing to restart the program.

### Setup

To set up the Caesar Cipher tool on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository or download `caesar_cipher.py`**: Ensure the file is stored in a directory accessible by your Python environment.
2. **Run `caesar_cipher.py`**: This will start the interactive tool. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. **Follow the prompts**: Input your choices and text as requested by the program.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- The optional `art.py` file for displaying an ASCII logo at the start of the program, enhancing the user interface.
