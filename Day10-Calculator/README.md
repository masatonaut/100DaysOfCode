# Python Calculator: An Interactive Command Line Calculator

This Python script provides an interactive calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It leverages simple command line inputs to enable users to perform calculations consecutively or restart with new values.

### Introduction

The Python Calculator is a straightforward script designed to help users perform arithmetic calculations through a command line interface. It offers a continuous calculation loop with the option to keep computing with the latest result or start afresh.

### Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).
- **Interactive Loop**: Continuously calculate with the previous result or restart with new values.
- **ASCII Art Logo**: Displays an ASCII art logo at the start of the program for visual appeal.
- **Clear Screen Functionality**: Utilizes the `os` module to clear the screen after a calculation sequence is complete, improving user experience.

### How to Use

1. **Running the Script**: Execute the Python script `calculator.py` in your preferred environment. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Perform Calculations**: Follow the prompts to input numbers and choose operations.
3. **Continuous Calculation**: Decide after each result if you want to continue with the result or start a new calculation.

### What You Need to Know

- **calculator.py**: This is the main script containing the logic for arithmetic operations and user interactions.
- **art.py**: This file must contain a `logo` variable which is displayed at the start of the program, enhancing the visual interface.

#### calculator.py

- Facilitates basic arithmetic operations through a dictionary linking symbols to function calls.
- Manages user inputs and displays results in a clear format.
- Utilizes a loop to allow for ongoing calculations with the option to clear the screen and start over.

### Setup

To set up the Python Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository or Download Files**: Ensure `calculator.py` and `art.py` are placed in your Python environment.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute `calculator.py` using a Python interpreter.
3. **Follow the Prompts**: Input numbers and operations as guided by the script's prompts.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- An `art.py` file for displaying an ASCII art logo, which enhances the user interface.
